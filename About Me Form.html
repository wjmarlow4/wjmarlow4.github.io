<p> Hello, my name is Jack Marlow. I am originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina but moved to apex around 10 years ago. Currently I am working at a company called Flytrex that uses drones to make deliveries to people at their house. Some of the things I am interested in or passionate about include learning new things, watching sports but mainly soccer, working out and spending time with friends and family. I also consider myself to be a hard worker when it comes to things, I am passionate about.</p>
